The Icecast YP log module logs snapshots of the YP directory stream 
listener counts on each cron run.  These snapshots are stored in the 
database for later analysis and graphing.

The built-in graphing functionality requires that the PEAR Image_Graph 
and Image_Canvas packages can be found on PHP's include path.
