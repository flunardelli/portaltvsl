Chat Room allows users to talk together in real time. Users enter chat rooms
which can have multiple chats. Permissions can be set to restrict who can
access, edit, and create chats and chat rooms.

INSTALLATION
============

1. Download the module from Drupal.org/project/chatroom and save it to your
   modules folder.
2. Enable the module at admin/build/modules.
3. Copy chatroomread.php from the chatroom folder to the webroot of your site.
   chatroomread.php should sit next to your index.php file.
4. Enable access to chatrooms and chat for some roles on your site.

HACKING
=======

Chatroom is currently under heavy development. The DRUPAL-6--2 branch is where
the action is, while the DRUPAL-6--1 branch is strictly for bug fixes, and will
be deprecated as soon as the DRUPAL-6--2 branch is stable enough.

Check the HACKING.txt file and the issues queue for the latest.

Patches, testers, feature suggestions, bug reports etc all welcome!
